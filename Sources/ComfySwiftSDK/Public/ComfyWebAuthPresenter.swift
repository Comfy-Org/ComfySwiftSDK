import Foundation

/// The browser step of the interactive OAuth sign-in, injected into
/// ``ComfyAuth/signIn(presenter:store:config:)`` so the SDK never imports
/// `AuthenticationServices`.
///
/// The SDK owns the whole authorization-code + PKCE handshake *except* actually presenting the
/// authorize URL to the user — that requires `ASWebAuthenticationSession` (UIKit/AppKit surface),
/// which the SDK deliberately keeps out of its import boundary (Foundation only). An app conforms a
/// thin type to this protocol over its own `ASWebAuthenticationSession`, and hands it to
/// ``ComfyAuth/signIn(presenter:store:config:)``.
///
/// A conformer opens a web authentication session for `url`, waits for the callback delivered to
/// `callbackURLScheme`, and returns that callback URL unchanged. The SDK then performs the
/// security-critical `state` verification and code extraction itself
/// (``OAuthAuthorizationRequest/extractCode(fromCallback:)``) — a conformer must **not** parse the
/// callback or short-circuit that check.
///
/// - Important: On user dismissal (the person taps *Cancel* / closes the sheet), a conformer must
///   throw ``ComfyError/authCancelled`` — the same case the SDK propagates from
///   ``ComfyAuth/signIn(presenter:store:config:)``, so callers distinguish "the user backed out"
///   from a genuine failure by catching a single, stable error type. Any other transport-level
///   error may be thrown as-is.
/// - Important: ``authenticate(url:callbackURLScheme:)`` is `@MainActor`. `ASWebAuthenticationSession`
///   (and the AppKit/UIKit presentation it drives) must be started on the main thread, and the SDK
///   invokes the presenter from a non-isolated executor — so the requirement pins the call to the
///   main actor for conformers, making a correct `start()` the default rather than a caller
///   responsibility.
